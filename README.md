# Data Science Pipeline Playground

Welcome to the Data Science Pipeline Playground! This repository is designed to help data science enthusiasts, from beginners to advanced practitioners, explore and contribute to various data science projects. Our goal is to create a collaborative space for learning, experimenting, and building end-to-end data science pipelines.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves multiple purposes:
1. Provide a platform for Hacktoberfest contributions
2. Offer hands-on experience with real-world data science projects
3. Demonstrate the entire data science pipeline from data collection to model deployment
4. Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the data science community

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main categories based on difficulty level:

- **Beginner**: Ideal for those new to data science
- **Intermediate**: Suitable for those with some experience
- **Advanced**: Challenging projects for seasoned data scientists

Each project within these categories follows a consistent structure:

project_name/
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── main.py
└── data/


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MohammedHamzaMalik/data-science-pipeline-playground.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd data-science-pipeline-playground
3. Choose a project from one of the difficulty levels
4. Follow the instructions in the project's README.md file

## 🤝 How to Contribute
